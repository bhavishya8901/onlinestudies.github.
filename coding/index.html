          Education is a purposeful activity directed at achieving certain aims,
          such as transmitting knowledge or fostering skills and character
          traits. These aims may include the development of understanding,
          rationality, kindness, and honesty. Various researchers emphasize the
          role of critical thinking in order to distinguish education from
          indoctrination. Some theorists require that education results in an
          improvement of the student while others prefer a value-neutral
          definition of the term. In a slightly different sense, education may
          also refer, not to the process, but to the product of this process:
          the mental states and dispositions possessed by educated people.
          Education originated as the transmission of cultural heritage from one
          generation to the next. Today, educational goals increasingly
          encompass new ideas such as the liberation of learners, skills needed
          for modern society, empathy, and complex vocational skills.

          History is also an academic discipline which uses narrative to
          describe, examine, question, and analyze past events, and investigate
          their patterns of cause and effect.[6][7] Historians often debate
          which narrative best explains an event, as well as the significance of
          different causes and effects. Historians also debate the nature of
          history as an end in itself, as well as its usefulness to give
          perspective on the problems of the present.[6][8][9][10]

          A computer is a digital electronic machine that can be programmed to
          carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations (computation)
          automatically. Modern computers can perform generic sets of operations
          known as programs. These programs enable computers to perform a wide
          range of tasks. A computer system is a "complete" computer that
          includes the hardware, operating system (main software), and
          peripheral equipment needed and used for "full" operation. This term
          may also refer to a group of computers that are linked and function
          together, such as a computer network or computer cluster.
